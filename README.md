🫀 Heart Disease Predictor
This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various medical parameters. Built using Python and popular ML libraries, the model is trained on the UCI Heart Disease dataset and provides fast, accurate predictions to support early diagnosis.

🔍 Features
Predicts heart disease risk based on inputs like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.

Uses supervised learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or SVM.

Clean, user-friendly interface (optionally built with Streamlit or Flask).

Model evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

Streamlit/Flask for frontend (if applicable)

Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization
